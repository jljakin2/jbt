Pick your favorite successful person or company. I guarantee they have at least 1 thing in common: a clear vision.

Without vision, it is easy to get distracted and work on things that don't get you traction toward your goals. I recognized this problem in my life a few years ago so I created a personal vision for my work:

## I want to use code to solve interesting problems with interesting people.

The great thing about a vision is it can be crafted to be a shareable package that can be unpacked into deeper and deeper levels to unveil values, interests, and passions about the individual or company.

Here is my unpacking...

## Why code?

I have never experienced anything that has come close to the engagement I feel with coding

I have tried many different functions over the last decade (digital marketing, project management, and consulting) but nothing compares to programming. The blend between structure and creativity that programming pulls you through sparks an immense level of flow.

I often find myself thinking about programming for a concerning amount of time throughout the day.

There is also the objective benefit of programming: leverage.

When comparing problem-solving tools, programming has to be at the top of the list simply due to its potential for leverage. A few lines of code or one program can solve a cascading number of problems for a lot of people over a long period.

A sprint of quality work can lead to a marathon of returns. Music to my ears.

## What are interesting problems?

The specific problems that I find interesting can vary depending on current events or the ever-changing context of my environment but there is a broader way that I tend to look at problems.

I heard Mark Zuckerberg explain one of the new values at Meta which he called "Build Awesome Things". He explained there has to be a balance between "useful" and "awe-inspiring" to maintain engagement. Solving problems that illicit "useful" solutions will pay the bills, but "awe-inspiring" solutions drive inspiration and engagement. If you go too far in one direction things can get out of balance.

I am most engaged when the blend of "useful" vs. "awe-inspiring" problems I am working on hovers around 50/50. I like to keep my feet on the ground but peek my head into the clouds now and then.

## What are interesting people?

Collaboration is the secret ingredient for all great work. As collaboration fades so does the quality of work.

I have found that collaboration increases with the following traits:

**Curiosity -** Curious people tend to be open to new ideas and are constantly experimenting. This leads to a greater diversity of thought. Everyone is learning new things and bringing their findings to the table. It supercharges the learning and decision-making process.

**Kindness -** Life is short. No one wants to work with jerks. Plus, kindness usually infers a certain level of trust and humbleness which leads to a higher quality of communication between the group.

**Action-biased** - I love being around people who "just go for it". They take their shots and ship work often. It is infectious to be around and makes me want to keep pushing my boundaries. Plus, the more shots or small bets that are taken, the more opportunities for the rest of the group to learn.

Let me know if you've ever played with the idea of a personal vision for your work. I'd love to hear it!
