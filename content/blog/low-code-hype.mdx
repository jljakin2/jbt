I donâ€™t understand the hype around low-code platforms.

I've built many apps using both low-code and plain old code. I prefer to use code for the majority of cases. When I was learning to code, automation was spreading through my organization thanks to a few low-code platforms. I decided to learn a few of them to get my hands dirty, but I noticed something right away.

**To maximize the potential of the low-code platform my coding knowledge was essential.**

Low-code platforms market their products in a way that makes it seem like anyone, at any skill or knowledge level, can use them to build all kinds of apps. I did not find this to be true.

**Without a basic understanding of things like relational data, storing state, and basic CRUD operations, I noticed some people trying to build apps using low-code struggled.**

This is why learning to code is still important even if you plan on only using low-code platforms.

## To be effective with low code you need core coding concepts

When it comes to app design, there is more to think about than what the interface will look like.

How does the data flow? How can you make the architecture as modular as possible? What about authentication and components? You can build apps using low code without having an understanding of some core programming concepts. But it will be painful.

Plus, one of the main benefits of low code is the speed at which you can develop. Poor architecture can negate the benefits of fast development all day long.

## Scale will throw a wrench in your low-code plans

Most low-code platforms have limits on users and data records.

They are not meant to scale. This can be fine if you only need an app for a small use case. Unfortunately, I have found that if you build a quality app, small use cases grow very large, very quickly.

Understanding some of the core programming concepts can help you avoid some of these problems but not for long.

More scale means more reliance on programming.

## Low-code platforms will come and go, but programming languages are more stable

I prefer to invest my time learning things that have a higher chance of long-term sustainability.

Low-code platforms are like any other software business in that they can come and go in a hurry. Even when they stick around, interface redesigns or changes in licensing can leave developers stuck with a lot of knowledge about something that doesn't exist anymore.

Save yourself the headache. Learn to code first, then use low-code platforms when it makes sense.
