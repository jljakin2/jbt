I love emojis. Who doesn‚Äôt?

I was polishing off a highly intellectual X post a few days ago when I realized something.

## Emojis aren‚Äôt counted the same as regular characters

When typing out emojis in the new post section of X, you can see how regular characters count less than emojis.

After a quick search, I found out it has something to do with [how they are encoded](https://help.postscript.io/hc/en-us/articles/1260804629950-How-Emojis-and-Special-Characters-Affect-Character-Counts) in the Unicode system.

Essentially, emojis are made of [multiple code points](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geodatabases/overview/a-quick-tour-of-unicode.htm#:~:text=Code points are the numbers,four numbers and%2For letters.), and `length` only counts code points, not characters.

Regardless of why it happens, I thought about all the text counters I‚Äôve created and how many exist in SaaS land.

Emojis are not getting their fair shake üò¢.

Simply taking the length of the string isn‚Äôt an accurate count. Take, for example, something like this:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  function countString() {
    return text.length;
  }

  function handleChange(e) {
    setText(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Make the emojis count üëç</h1>
      <textarea value={text} onChange={handleChange} />
      <small>Characters: {countString()}</small>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is a simple React component that tracks the characters typed into a text field. It is the most common implementation of this feature.

But the output gives us the same problem as my X post:

## Modern web development makes it easy to count characters accurately

You can use a [built-in object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Segmenter) called <Code>Intl.Segmenter</Code>.

There is a much broader use case for the object, but it essentially breaks down strings into more meaningful items like words and sentences based on a locale you provide. It offers more granularity than simply using code points.

To fix our example above, all we have to do is update our `countString` function like this:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  function countString() {
    return Array.from(new Intl.Segmenter().segment(text)).length;
  }

  function handleChange(e) {
    setText(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Make the emojis count üëç</h1>
      <textarea value={text} onChange={handleChange} />
      <small>Characters: {countString()}</small>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We create a new instance of the `Intl.Segmenter` object and pass our text to it. We put that output into an array and then finally take the `length`, which will be far more accurate than simply taking the `length` of the original string.

Here is the result:

## So why doesn‚Äôt X count an emoji correctly?

Short answer: I have no idea.

I‚Äôve been programming far too long to delude myself into thinking there is a simple answer.

But `Intl.Segmenter` has [good browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=Intl.Segmenter), and any performance or memory constraints would be negligible.

My best guess is that the codebase is so large and so old that it isn‚Äôt worth the side effects of a refactor.

I‚Äôd be happy to learn more if anyone has better insight into this.

I hope this helps üòÑ.

Happy coding ü§ô.
