If you've ever struggled with writing essays from scratch, you're not alone. In the past three weeks, I've written an essay every day and discovered a simple writing process to make it more manageable. Follow these steps to improve your consistency and make essay writing a breeze.

## Step 1: Create an Essay Tracker

Breaking the writing process into parts makes staying consistent easier. Use any tool that allows you to quickly capture ideas and track your essay through its various stages. The key is to have an organized system to follow your essay's progress.

## Step 2: Break Down Your Essay into Sections

Here's my writing process: Idea → Headline → Main Points → Writing → Publish. Create a section in your tracker for each step and work on each step a little bit every day for various essays. This approach helps you stay on track and maintain momentum.

## Step 3: Gather Templates

Using templates from resources like Typeshare is a great starting point, but creating your own based on writing that resonates with you is even more important. As you read, ask yourself why something resonates and document it in a template to avoid starting from scratch.

## Step 4: Use Hemingway App and Grammarly for Writing

Guardrails are essential when writing. Once your structure is in place, dump your thoughts onto the screen. Hemingway App and Grammarly help you stay focused on getting ideas out, not on editing. These tools keep you in check and free up your brain capacity.

### Summary

To stay consistent with your essay writing, follow this simple process: create an essay tracker, break down your essay into sections, gather templates, and use Hemingway App and Grammarly for writing. With this approach, you'll find it easier to write essays consistently and improve your skills.
