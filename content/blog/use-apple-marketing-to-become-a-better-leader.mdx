In 1977, Apple created one of the most simple yet effective marketing strategies based on 3 principles: Empathy, Focus, and Impute. This can also be a great framework for leadership. Here's how you can apply it to become a better leader today:

## Empathy

### Intimate connection with the feelings of others

As we go through our work, it's essential to take the time to understand the people around us. Operating on assumptions can be a dangerous game. Instead, ask questions and listen actively, allowing others to tell you what they need.

## Focus

### Eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities

In a world full of "shiny" opportunities, it's a superpower to decide on a strategy and ignore everything else. Focus on finding the highest leverage tasks and protect them fiercely, even when it feels unpopular. This unwavering dedication will set you apart as a leader.

## Impute

### People DO judge a book by its cover

How you do anything is how you do everything, especially as a leader. The tone of any group or organization stems from what the leader does, so it's crucial to prepare and act accordingly. Be mindful of your image and the impact it has on your team.

Use Apple's simple early marketing principles to become a better leader. Practice empathy, maintain focus, and be mindful of your image as a leader.
