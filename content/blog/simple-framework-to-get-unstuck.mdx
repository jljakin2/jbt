I've consulted more than 20 teams in various functions over the last 5 years.

When you work with that many teams, patterns start to emerge. Patterns that lead to streamlined work and patterns that create dysfunction.

One of the most common patterns that lead to people not getting things done comes from how the team defines tasks.

**In order to combat this, I like to ask teams this question: does the way this task is defined feel like "light work" or "heavy work"?**

Let's say you are having communication problems with another team. They are not giving you proper notice when things are going to be late and you are tasked with solving this problem. Which one of these task definitions would be more likely to spark action?

"Solve communication problem with X team"

"Set a meeting with Mr. X to understand why the last 3 deadlines have been missed"

## Light Work vs. Heavy Work

Option #1 is "heavy". It makes my stomach hurt which probably means it will sit on my to-do list until the absolute last possible minute. Not a recipe for work efficiency.

I can wrap my head around Option #2. It feels "light". And since I can wrap my head around it, I can probably figure out where it will fit into my schedule which is half of the battle of getting the task done.

_The unfortunate thing though is that Option #1 is just easier to jot down._

It is easier to draft an email and have someone else figure it out. However, the downstream effects of circulating poorly defined tasks are detrimental to any team.

When you have a "heavy" task like "solve a communication problem with X team" the number of ways you could start is endless. It is like trying to problem-solve without constraints. More avenues mean less action. Less action means nothing gets done.

Instead, I coach my teams to think in terms of "light" work packages that might still require some complexity, autonomy, and hard work, but at least you won't have to guess what the next action should be. You just have to put the work in.

Do this over and over and all of sudden those "parking lot" items that have been collecting dust in the corner of your team board will start to disappear.
