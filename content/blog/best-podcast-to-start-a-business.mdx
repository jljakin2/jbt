Podcasts are no doubt one of the best ways to learn but they can also be a great way to change your day-to-day environment to motivate you to change your behavior.

I found this podcast last year called [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/). Admittedly, it is one of the many pieces of content in the entrepreneurship space that is cursed by a poor name choice (looking at you Tim Ferriss ðŸ‘€), but don't let that deter you.

The hosts are two former founders who sold their businesses a few years ago and are working on their next ventures. They talk about current events, interesting businesses or trends they are investigating, stories from their past businesses, and (my favorite part) tons and tons of great ideas for potential businesses.

If you are looking for a casual business podcast to keep your entrepreneur mind sharp each week, look no further.

## Here are 5 specific reasons why listening to "My First Million" will motivate you to start your business this year:

**The ideas are quality:** I've never heard so many quality business ideas in one place for FREE. After listening to this podcast, the excuse of "I just don't have any good business ideas" will no longer be valid.

**The guests are quality:** The podcast doesn't always have guests but when they do the guests are super insightful! Since the podcast is more casual, the conversations usually lead to discussion topics that aren't normally explored in more structured interviews.

**It is very casual:** It feels like you are sitting in on a casual conversation between two of your close friends who just happen to be super successful at business. This means it is easy to listen to so you can have it on while doing other things like working, cleaning, working out, etc. More opportunities to listen means more potential for the information to sink in.

**They are transparent with actual numbers:** It is refreshing to hear actual numbers behind businesses. You don't just get the numbers behind their businesses but they encourage any guest or friend of theirs to share their numbers as well so you can start to get proper context for the types of businesses you can create.

**They make starting businesses seem attainable:** They aren't talking to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. They talk about and investigate businesses that anyone can create. It shows you how attainable starting a business can be if you work on the right things and ask the right questions.

If you start listening, let me know. Maybe we can start a podcast listening club (are those a thing yet?) to discuss how we are applying the lessons to our own work.
