When you see a book that you think could help solve a problem, buy it. Don't think twice. Just buy it.

Not all books may be worth the investment but consider the act of purchasing a book like placing a bunch of small bets with the potential for outsized returns. Over the long run, you will win big.

Here are the top 3 reasons why books are the greatest investment you can make.

## Reason #1: The "monetary" cost to acquire the knowledge is CRAZY low

What does the average book cost?

Around $15? Maybe $30-50 for higher-end books.

What do you get in return?

An organized and distilled version of the learnings from someone else spending 6 months to a year of their time. Or in some cases, multiple years or an entire career's worth of time and learnings.

And they only want $15? Yes, please.

## Reason #2: The time and cost to acquire the knowledge is CRAZY low

How long does it take to read a 250-page book?

I looked it up. On average, it takes 6.9 hours. That is amazing!

In under one day, you could go from being clueless about a topic to having a comprehensive understanding. One day!

Paired with a bias towards action, the time spent reading books could make you an unstoppable problem-solving machine.

## Reason #3: The packaging of the information is organized, convenient, and shareable

With so much knowledge and information packed in a book, you'd think the package would have to be massive.

An entire person's career of learning must fill an entire desk. Or at least fill a couple of large boxes, right?

Nope.

It is packaged up in a rectangle smaller than a regular sheet of paper and only a few inches thick. You can take them anywhere and share them with anyone maximizing the learning potential.

You'd also think that with so much information it would be a jumbled mess. Think again. An entire team spent a significant amount of brainpower organizing the information in a way that makes it as absorbable as possible.

It is so organized that at the end of the book is a list of all the books that were used to craft the information in the book you are currently reading. One great investment leads to another.

All for under $20-30? Go ahead. Buy that book.
