I've used books, YouTube, Coursera, Udacity, CodeCademy, Treehouse, and several other platforms while learning to code.

The platform that is most responsible, however, for taking my abilities from the basics to building functional apps is **Udemy**. Udemy is underrated mostly because of the ranging level of quality. It is sort of the wild west. It can be hard to know what is worth your time and what isn't.

Say no more. I've tested tons of different courses on Udemy so you don't have to.

## Here are the top 3 developer teachers on Udemy that are worth your time:

**[Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/): Best for beginner web and app developers**. She has a couple of great bootcamps that can get you up and running creating web apps, iOS apps, and Android apps. Her ability to use stories and visuals makes it super easy to follow along and learn fast.

**[Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/): Best for deep dives into the latest tools for web app development.** Stephen is prolific. The amount of information he is able to cover in one course is amazing. And he has a ton of courses. Everything ranging from getting started with web app development to more advanced things like micro-services architectures. He balances nitty-gritty details with high-level visual overviews.

**[Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/): Best for Python developers and aspiring data scientists.** Jose's content shares a lot of the same traits as Angela and Stephen: comprehensive courses that take the complex and make it simple. If you've wanted to learn Python or if you know Python and want to take the next steps into data science and machine learning, I don't know of an easier way to make that jump. You'll be up and running in no time.

#### Let me know if you try out any of these teachers or have other favorites on Udemy.

Happy coding!
